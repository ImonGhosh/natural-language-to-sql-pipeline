Table,Description
fact_metrics_large,"Core fact table that stores overall market metrics per slice, with one row per market / country / region / city combination (e.g., 'EU / Germany / Bavaria / Munich'). Contains KPIs such as purchase intent, revenue, share, average price, and sample size (n). Serves as the central table that other fact tables reference via a fact_id."
fact_campaign_metrics,"Stores marketing campaign activity for each market slice. Each row represents one campaign linked to a specific fact_metrics_large row via fact_id (e.g., a campaign running in Munich). Includes fields such as campaign_name, channel (e.g., Online, TV, OOH), spend, impressions, clicks, conversions, start_date, and end_date. Used to analyze how marketing actions relate to market KPIs."
fact_segment_metrics,"Captures segment-level breakdowns of market metrics for each fact_metrics_large row. Each record represents one customer segment within a market slice, identified by segment_code (e.g., AGE_18_24, HEAVY_USER) and segment_label (e.g., 'Age 18–24'). Stores metrics like m_purchase_intent, m_share, m_avg_price, and m_n. Enables analysis of how performance differs across demographic or behavioral segments inside the same market/city."
