0. Main table: fact_metrics_large (what everything hangs on)

Each row = one market slice, for example:

“EU / Germany / Bavaria / Munich” with metrics like purchase intent, revenue, share, avg price, sample size.

So think:

Where: market, country, region, city

What numbers: purchase intent, revenue, share, avg price, n

All other tables just add more detail to that row.

1. fact_campaign_metrics

“What campaigns were running for this market/city, and what did they do?”

Each row = one campaign linked to one fact row.

Very roughly:

fact_id → points to the row in fact_metrics_large (e.g. Munich)

campaign_name → "Summer Sale 2025"

channel → "Online", "TV", "OOH", etc.

spend → how much money was spent

impressions, clicks, conversions → basic campaign KPIs

start_date, end_date → when the campaign ran

So you can say things like:

“In Munich, when purchase intent was 0.62, these 3 campaigns were active, with X € spend and Y conversions.”

It’s just “marketing activity” tied back to your market metrics.

2. fact_segment_metrics

“How do the numbers look for different groups of people inside this market/city?”

Each row = one segment for one fact row.

fact_id → again, links to the main row (e.g. Munich)

segment_code → short code like AGE_18_24, HEAVY_USER, NON_USER

segment_label → readable text like "Age 18–24" or "Heavy users"

m_purchase_intent, m_share, m_avg_price, m_n → the same type of metrics, but for that segment only

| fact_id | segment_code | segment_label | m_purchase_intent | m_share | m_n |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------------- | ------- | --- |
| 101     | AGE_18_24    | Age 18–24     | 0.75              | 0.30    | 60  |
| 101     | AGE_25_44    | Age 25–44     | 0.60              | 0.22    | 80  |
| 101     | AGE_45_64    | Age 45–64     | 0.50              | 0.18    | 40  |


So you can answer:

“In Munich, younger people have higher purchase intent and share than older groups.”

Short version:

fact_metrics_large = overall numbers per market / country / region / city

fact_campaign_metrics = which campaigns & media ran there, with spend & performance

fact_segment_metrics = breakdown of the same metrics by customer segment
